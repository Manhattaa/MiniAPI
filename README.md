## Hello and welcome to my API project.

This program is a simple web API built using REST architecture where the goal is to showcase and store data within a local database themed around a School.

The functions include and aren't limited to the following;

* Store basic information such as First and Last names of students, but also their phone number.
* Store interests of each student. These interests typically has a title and a description.
* Store multiple interests per student that can be shared among other students. Creating a link.

  To use this API to it's full potential i would recommend downloading and installing an API development program such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com//). [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), or my personal choice: [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)


### The following commands are used in this project to pull and push data to and from the Database.
